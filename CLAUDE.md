- Please read the README.md file to understand what this project is about.
- The only deployable lives at packages/nestjs-endpoints
- There are five test projects at packages/test:
  - All test-app-\* projects are meant to test backend calls both regular http calls and using the generated axios client
  - I only write tests for those in packages/test/test-app-express-cjs, since scripts/test.sh copies the app and test source files to the other test-app-\* projects.
    - Main test file for http calls using supertest are in packages/test/test-app-express-cjs/test/app.e2e-spec.ts
    - Test file for calls using the axios client are in packages/test/test-app-express-cjs/test/client.e2e-spec.ts
    - Other files have specific purposes
  - packages/test/test-react-query-client is meant to test the generated react-query client.
    - You will need to first add code in packages/test/test-react-query-client/src that imports the client queries or mutations, and then add tests in packages/test/test-react-query-client/test
